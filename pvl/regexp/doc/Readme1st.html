Readme for Regular Expression</h1></center>

<h4>
The need to use RegularExpressions</h4>
Not every drive schould handle every kind of request. There are two inputs
that can match on each other or not.
<br>The first one is given by the administator. He gives in a set of data
(<a href="TreeCut.html#prod1">expression</a>) for each Drive.&nbsp; The
second input (<a href="SyntaTrial.html#prod1">assignment</a>) is made by
the user. He produces the request.
<br>If the values of the request object match the expression of the drive
the request may be served by that drive. In other case it couldn't be handled.
In this case this Request may fit to another drive.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
How we use it</h4>
Both sets of data are strings. And both strings are checkt on corect syntax
and compiled by parsers. The compiler for drive expressions delivers an
unresolved tree. The output of the compiler for requestassigns pruduces
a hashtable.&nbsp; They are <a href="Testdata.html">compared</a> by a third
tool. It results a Boolean. A TRUE means that the expression of the request
fit the expression of the drive.
<p>An <a href="RegExSample.java">example</a> shows better how to use the
compilers and the comperator.
<p>The two Parsers&nbsp; were generated by Sriram Sankars compilercompiler
called Javacc. Javacc(Copyright (c) 1996-1999 Sun Microsystems, Inc. Copyright
(c) 1997-1999 Metamata, Inc.).
<br>Like lex and yacc Javacc is a tool to create compilers. But Javacc
is written in and produces code in Java and&nbsp; accepts LL(k) grammars
as opposed to LALR grammars used by yacc.
