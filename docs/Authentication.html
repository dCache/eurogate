<h1>The Eurogate Authentication</h1>
<a name=firstlogin></a>
<h3>First login</h3>
<blockquote>
User, Acl and Pvl administration are only possible 
through a secure ssh (versionI) connection. The portnumber currently
used for the connection is <i>23126</I>.
As long as no additional user has been defined, only
the user 'admin' will have access to the system.
The eurogate ssh server allows the <i>idea</i> and the
<i>blowfish</i> cipher for the secure communication.
An example for a login as admin from any host is :
<pre>
ssh -p 23126 -c blowfish -l admin eustore1.cern.ch
</pre>
On eustore1 itself the following will do as well
<pre>
./jobs/eurogate admin -l admin 
</pre>
Eurogate will ask for the access password. The initial
password for the admin user of a newly configured 
system is 'dickerelch'. The password should be changed
after the first login.
<pre>
AclCell(admin) >> set passwd -old=dickerelch adminx adminx
</pre>
The above command will change the password of 'admin' from
'dickerelch' to 'adminx'.
<p><strong>Remark :</strong><BR>
The control-i character switches the ssh connection to
'non echo'. This allows to type passwords without being
echoed. The next CR resets the stream to echo mode again.

<h3>Creating additional users.</h3>
<blockquote>
Eurogate provides fine grained administration and configuration
control with the help of <a href=AclIntro.html>Access control lists (ACL's)</a>.
To make use of this feature, additional users or groups with modified
access permission can be created.
<p>
<strong>Remark :</strong> The 'admin' user lives outside of all
acls. In other words, the admin account has all possible privileges
within eurogate. No privileges can be added or removed to/from
this account. Therefore, the admin account should
only be used for the initial configuration, and the admin password 
should be a well bewared secret.
<p>
A new user is created with the command :
<pre>
create user &lt;userName&gt;
</pre>
For simplicity, we assume, we are working under the 'admin' account to create the
first users. Otherwise we first have to learn more about the
Eurogate <a href=AclIntro.html>ACL's</a>.
<p>
Eurogate distinguishes between two different types of users.
<p><strong>Users already known to the local OS</strong><p>
<blockquote>
In this case, creating the user with 'create user ..' is sufficent to
allow the login into Eurogate. The password is identical to the
OS password. The eurogate 'set passwd' <strong>can not</strong>
be used to change the password of such a user. The password change 
need to be done with OS specific commands.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Users not known to the local OS</strong><p>
<blockquote>
In this case an inital password has to be set.
<pre>
AclCell(admin) >> set passwd -user=&lt;userName&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt;
</pre>
Now the new user can login and may/should change his password with
<pre>
AclCell(userName) >> set passwd -old=&lt;oldPassword&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt;
</pre>
Remember to type CONTROL-i before typing the passwords.
</blockquote>
<p>
After a new user has been create, he may login by
<pre>
on eustore1 :
./jobs/eurogate admin -l &lt;userName&gt;  

or from any other host ( ssh must be version I )

ssh -p 23126 -c blowfish -l &lt;userName&gt; eustore1.cern.ch
#### type user password ####
</pre>
All users other than 'admin' only have permission to perform
query commands as long as the user name has not been added to
the ACL associated with the requested command.

<h3>Eurogate Login Modes</h3>
<blockquote>
The Eurogate Login Manager divides the command set into logical units
to simply administration. 
After being logged in, the prompt indicated the current active user name
and mode of the session. 
<pre>
AclCell(admin) >>   for the admin user in acl mode, or
pvl(admin) >>       for the admin user in pvl mode.
</pre>
The AclCell mode supports the administration of users, groups, ACL's
and user passwords. The pvl mode administers the pvl, pvrs drives
a.s.o..<p>
At any time the modes can be switched with :
<pre>
AclCell(admin) >> .cd pvl      # for the pvl mode
pvl(admin) >>     .cd AclCell  # for the acl mode
AclCell(admin >> 
</pre> 
In both modes, the help command dumps a one line summary of the commands.
'help' followed by the command displays a detailed description.
