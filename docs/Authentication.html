<h1>The Eurogate Authentication</h1>
<h3>First login</h3>
<blockquote>
User, Acl and Pvl administration are only possible 
through a secure ssh (versionI) connection. The portnumber currently
defined for the connection is <i>23126</I>.
As long as no additional user has been defined, only
the user 'admin' will have access to the system.
The eurogate ssh server allows the <i>idea</i> and the
<i>blowfish</i> cipher for the secure communication.
An example for a login as admin from any host is :
<pre>
ssh -p 23126 -c blowfish -l admin eustore1.cern.ch
</pre>
On eustore1 itself the following will do as well
<pre>
./jobs/eurogate admin -l admin 
</pre>
Eurogate will ask for the access password. The initial
password for the admin user of a newly configured 
system is 'dickerelch'. The password should be changed
after the first login.
<pre>
AclCell(admin) >> set passwd -old=dickerelch adminx adminx
</pre>
The above command will change the password of 'admin' from
'dickerelch' to 'adminx'.
To hide the password typed on the screen from being 
seen by others one may type Ctrl-i before typing
the new password. The characters are no longer echoed.
The CRLF will create the state to normal again. The new
password has to repeated to avoid mistyping.
</blockquote>
<h3>Creating additional users.</h3>
<blockquote>
Eurogate provides fine grained administration and configuration
control with the help of <i>Access control lists (ACL's)</i>.
To make use of this feature, additional users with modified
access permission can be created.
<p>
<strong>Remark :</strong> The 'admin' user lives outside of all
acls. In other words, the admin account has all possible privileges
within eurogate. No priviliges can be added or removed to/from
this account. Therefore, the admin account should
only be used for the initial configuration, and the admin password 
should be well beware secret.
<p>
A new user is created with the command :
<pre>
create user &lt;userName&gt;
</pre>
To create users, the acl <i>user.*.create</i> is needed. 
( See the chapter <i>Acls in Eurogate</i> for the meaning of Acl's ).
For simplisity, we assume, we are working under the 'admin' account to create the
first users.
<p>
Depending on whether the newly created user already exists as local user
on the OS (which is eustore1.cern.ch in our case) or not.
<p><strong>The user already is a local OS user</strong><br>
In this case creating the user with 'create user ..' is sufficent to
let guy loggin into Eurogate. The password is identical to the
OS password. The eurogate 'set passwd' can not be used to change the
password of such a user.
<p><strong>The user is unknown to the local OS</strong><br>
In this case an inital password has to be set.
<pre>
set passwd -user=&lt;userName&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt;
</pre>
Now the new user can login and may change his password with
<pre>
set passwd -old=&lt;oldPassword&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt;
</pre>
Remember to type CONTROL-i before type the passwords.
