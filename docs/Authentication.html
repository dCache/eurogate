<h1>The Eurogate Authentication</h1>
<h3>First login</h3>
<blockquote>
User, Acl and Pvl administration are only possible 
through a secure ssh (versionI) connection. The portnumber currently
defined for the connection is <i>23126</I>.
As long as no additional user has been defined, only
the user 'admin' will have access to the system.
The eurogate ssh server allows the <i>idea</i> and the
<i>blowfish</i> cipher for the secure communication.
An example for a login as admin from any host is :
<pre>
ssh -p 23126 -c blowfish -l admin eustore1.cern.ch
</pre>
On eustore1 itself the following will do as well
<pre>
./jobs/eurogate admin -l admin 
</pre>
Eurogate will ask for the access password. The initial
password for the admin user of a newly configured 
system is 'dickerelch'. The password should be changed
after the first login.
<pre>
AclCell(admin) >> set passwd -old=dickerelch adminx adminx
</pre>
The above command will change the password of 'admin' from
'dickerelch' to 'adminx'.
<p><strong>Remark :</strong><BR>
The control-i character switches the ssh connection to
'non echo'. This allows to type passwords without being
echoed. The next CR resets the stream to echo mode again.
</blockquote>
<h3>Creating additional users.</h3>
<blockquote>
Eurogate provides fine grained administration and configuration
control with the help of <i>Access control lists (ACL's)</i>.
To make use of this feature, additional users with modified
access permission can be created.
<p>
<strong>Remark :</strong> The 'admin' user lives outside of all
acls. In other words, the admin account has all possible privileges
within eurogate. No privileges can be added or removed to/from
this account. Therefore, the admin account should
only be used for the initial configuration, and the admin password 
should be a well bewared secret.
<p>
A new user is created with the command :
<pre>
create user &lt;userName&gt;
</pre>
To create a user, the acl <i>user.*.create</i> is needed. 
( See the chapter <i>Acls in Eurogate</i> for the meaning of Acl's ).
For simplicity, we assume, we are working under the 'admin' account to create the
first users.
<p>
Eurogate distinquishes between two different types of users.
<p><strong>Users already known to the local OS</strong><p>
<blockquote>
In this case, creating the user with 'create user ..' is sufficent to
allow the login into Eurogate. The password is identical to the
OS password. The eurogate 'set passwd' <strong>can not</strong>
be used to change the password of such a user. The password change 
need to be done with OS specific commands.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Users not known to the local OS</strong><p>
<blockquote>
In this case an inital password has to be set.
<pre>
set passwd -user=&lt;userName&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt;
</pre>
Now the new user can login and may/should change his password with
<pre>
set passwd -old=&lt;oldPassword&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt; &lt;newPassword&gt;
</pre>
Remember to type CONTROL-i before typing the passwords.
