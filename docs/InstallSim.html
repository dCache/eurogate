<h1>Eurogate Installation in Simulation Mode</h1>

<h3>Installing the package</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Installation from CD</strong><p> The installation CD
contains an installation script 'install.sh' which
does most of the work. The software goes to /opt/EurogateV7 by default,
or any other directory if specified otherwise. 
<pre>
cd /cdrom/hsm
./install.sh
</pre>
<li><strong>Installation from eg.tar file</strong><p>
Create the sourceRoot directory. The default for this version
is /opt/EurogateV7 and deflate the eg.tar file into this directory.
<pre>
mkdir -p /opt/EurogateV7
cp ???/eg.tar /opt/EurogateV7
cd /opt/EurogateV7
tar xf eg.tar
</pre>
</ul>
<h3>Database Preparation</h3>
<blockquote>
In simulation mode, the data files are stored on the local filesystem.
Therefore there must be suffient disk space to hold the datafiles.
When starting the SimulationSystem the first time, all necessary
initialization is done automatically. The administrator has to 
supply the system with an empty subdirectory. 
(The <strong>&lt;databaseRoot&gt;</strong>)
<pre>
mkdir -p &lt;databaseRoot&gt;
</pre>
<li><strong>Customizing the setup file</strong><p>
<ul>
<li>Change to the &lt;eurogate&gt;/jobs directory.
<li>copy eurogateSetup.template to eurogateSetup.
<li>Customize the content of  eurogateSetup. The setupfile
    contains key value pairs which determine the
    behaviour of the system. Some of the values are
    already set to a reasonable value, others MUST be
    tuned to fit the site specific needs.
  <ul>
  <li><strong>databaseRoot</strong> must be set to the directory
      path prepared above. When the system is started the first time,
      this subdirectory must be empty. It must provide sufficent
      disk space to hold the datafile, simulating the tapes.
  <li><strong>java</strong> If 'java' is not set, the system assumes to find
      the java binary in the PATH variable.
  </ul>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3>Starting/Stopping the system</h3>
<blockquote>
The system is started and stopped from within the
'jobs' directory.
<pre>
cd ../jobs
./eurogate start

resp.

./eurogate stop
</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Administering the system</h3>
<blockquote>
The system provides a graphical and a line interface
for most administative and monitoring tasks.
For the command line interface it uses the ssh Version I 
protocol for login. Both access methods are started from 
within the eurogate jobs directory 
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Command Line</strong>
<pre>
./eurogate admin -l admin
</pre>
The initial password is 'dickerelch'
<p>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong>
<pre>
./eurogate gui
</pre>
The login user name has to be changed to 'admin' and the
initial password is 'dickerelch'.
<p>
See <a href=EuroGuide.html>EuroGuide</a> for administration commands.
</ul>
