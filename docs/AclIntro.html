<h1>Access Control Lists</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Access Control Lists (<i>ACL's</i>) are a common way to control
the access of users, groups, processes etc. to resources or
objects in general. In the case of the Eurogate implementation,
not the object is protected by the ACL but the actions on the object.
So each action on an object has its own ACL which is different from
most other implementations, where only on ACL belongs to an
object an the individual actions are associated to so called
<i>Access Control Elements</i>.
Within eurogate the ACL is a named object with a canonical
name of <i>&lt;objectClass&gt;.&lt;objectName&gt;.&lt;action&gt;</i>.
Because of the fact that an ACL is an object as well, ACLs can be
created to protect actions on other ACL's.
<p>
<strong>Example : </strong>Not everybody should be allowed to disable a drive,
lets say driveX within a robot.
So the action <i>disable</i> of object <i>driveX</i> of class
<i>drive</i> needs an ACL which defines who is allowed to
perform the action.
The name of the related ACL, in our case, would be
<i>drive.driveX.disable</i>. This ACL is nothing else but a 
list of users or groups which are allowed to perform
the 'disable' action and possibly which are disallowed to do it.
The ACL to modify this ACL itself, ( e.g. adding an entry )
would then be <i>acl.drive.driveX.disable.modify</i>.
This means, the object class is 'acl' the object name
is 'drive.driveX.disable' and the action is 'modify'.
This is the ACL one needs to add a user to the ACL
<i>drive.driveX.disable</i>. This scheme can be extended
infinitely.
</p>
<p>
Theoretically one could add individual users to the different ACLs 
to allow or disallow certain actions. But the most common way
to deligate permissions is to create groups with fixed profiles
and to add users to these groups which should share these
permissions.
<h3>Eurogate ACL rules</h3>
There is a small set of rules which have to be taken into account.
<ul>
<li>'Principal' is  the common name for users and groups as long as
    there is no need to distiguesh between them.
<li>Actions, which do not have an ACL associated, are disallowed for
    everybody, except the <i>admin</i> account and principals possitively
    listed in the <i>super.access</i> ACL.
<li>If a principal is neither directly nor indirecty ( through groups )
    mentioned in a certain ACL, this principal is not allowed to perform 
    the action associated with this ACL.
<li>If a principal belongs to more than one group and at least one of these
    groups is member of the 'allow' list of an ACL, this principal is
    allowed to perform the related action, independend of the
    permissions of the other groups.
<li>Assuming, a principal belongs to a group which themself belongs to a group
    and so on.
    <pre>
      principal-T (belongs to) group-A (belongs to) group-B (.....) group-X
    </pre>
    To check whether the principal is allowed or disallowed for
    an action associated with ACL-Y,
    one has to check the principals from left to right against
    this ACL. As soon, as the principal/group is mentioned in ACL Y
    this ACL is in effect for principal-T. The permission of all
    groups following (on the right), are no longer of interrest.
    If the ACL is not mentioned in the chain at all, principal-T
    is disallowed for the action.
<li>There exists a single inheritance between ACLs. 
    A ACL-A with inherits from  ACL-B inherits all its entries.
    An additional, an entries in ACL-A overwrites a possible entry in ACL-B.
</ul>
There is a <a href=Acls.html>list</a> of the ACLs associated with 
Eurogate commands.
<h3>Some examples</h3>
<strong>Two groups, two ACLs</strong>
<blockquote>
There are two different ACLs associated with the Eurogate drives.
<ul>
<li><i>pvr.&lt;pvrName&gt;.manageDrives</i> which controls the
       enable, disable and dismount actions on drives belonging
       to &lt;pvrName&gt;.
<li><i>pvr.&lt;pvrName&gt;.modify</i> which allows to set 
       attributes like drive idle time and the selection string of
       all drives belonging to &lt;pvrName&gt;.
</ul>
While the enable/disable/dismount commands are usually needed to operate 
a robot to allow maintaining periods a.s.o., the different 'set drive' variants
are used to define the behaviour of the drive. The first command
set is typically of interrest of the operating team, the 'set drive' command
set should be restricted to the experts.
The following commands realize exactly this scheme. Although
these commands could be delegated to other users, we assume that
we are currently holding the 'admin' account.
<pre>
#
#  we need to create the acl first.
#
create acl pvr.stk.manageDrives
create acl pvr.stk.modify
#
#  create the groups
#
create group experts
create group operating
#
#  add the groups to the related ACL's
#
add access -allowed pvr.stk.manageDrives operating
add access -allowed pvr.stk.modify  experts
#
#  add users to the different groups.
#
add snoopy to experts
add magnum to operating
</pre>
So, all users added to the group operating will have the pvr.stk.manageDrives
priviliges and all users added to the experts group will have pvr.stk.modify
permission. But this is not exactly what we need. The experts group should
as well be allowed to enable/disable/dismount commands.
One solution would be to add experts to the pvr.stk.manageDrives ACL or to
add the experts group to the operating group.
<pre>
add experts to operating
</pre>
In the latter case the result looks as expected :
<pre>
AclCell(admin) >> show acl pvr.stk.modify
experts -> true
AclCell(admin) >> show acl pvr.stk.manageDrives
operating -> true
AclCell(admin) >> check pvr.stk.manageDrives operating
<font color=green>Allowed</font>
AclCell(admin) >> check pvr.stk.manageDrives experts
<font color=green>Allowed</font>
AclCell(admin) >> check pvr.stk.modify experts
<font color=green>Allowed</font>
AclCell(admin) >> check pvr.stk.modify operating
<font color=red>Denied</font>
</pre>
