<h3>Introduction</h3>
Access Control Lists (<i>ACL's</i>) are a common way to control
the access of users, groups, processes etc. to resources or
objects in general. In the case of the Eurogate implementation,
not the object is protected by the ACL but the actions on the object.
So each action on an object has its own ACL which is different from
most other implementations, where only one ACL belongs to an
object and the individual actions are associated to so called
<i>Access Control Elements</i>.
Within eurogate the ACL is a named object with the canonical
name of <i>&lt;objectClass&gt;.&lt;objectName&gt;.&lt;action&gt;</i>.
Because of the fact that an ACL is an object as well, ACLs can be
created to protect actions on other ACLs.
<p>
<strong>Example : </strong>Not everybody should be allowed to disable a drive,
lets say driveX within a robot.
So the action <i>disable</i> of object <i>driveX</i> of class
<i>drive</i> needs an ACL which defines who is allowed to
perform the action.
The name of the related ACL, in our case, would be
<i>drive.driveX.disable</i>. This ACL is nothing else but a 
list of users or groups which are allowed to perform
the 'disable' action and possibly which are disallowed to do it.
The ACL to modify this ACL itself, ( e.g. adding an entry )
would then be <i>acl.drive.driveX.disable.modify</i>.
This means, the object class is 'acl' the object name
is 'drive.driveX.disable' and the action is 'modify'.
This is the ACL one needs to add a user to the ACL
<i>drive.driveX.disable</i>. This scheme can be extended
infinitely.
</p>
<p>
Theoretically one could add individual users to the different ACLs 
to allow or disallow certain actions. But the most common way
to deligate permissions is to create groups with fixed profiles
and to add users to these groups which should share these
permissions.

<h3>Eurogate ACL rules</h3>
There is a small set of rules which have to be taken into account.
<ul>
<li>'Principal' is  the common name for users and groups as long as
    there is no need to distinguish between them.
<li>Actions, which do not have an ACL associated, will follow the rules
    destribed in <a href=#aclin>Acl Inheritance</a>.
<li>If a principal is neither directly nor indirecty (through groups 
    or inheritance)
    mentioned in a certain ACL, this principal is not allowed to perform 
    the action associated with this ACL.
<li>If a principal belongs to more then one group and at least one of these
    groups is member of the 'allow' list of an ACL, this principal is
    allowed to perform the related action, independend of the
    permissions of the other groups.
<li>Assuming, a principal belongs to a group which itself belongs to a group
    and so on.
    <pre>
      principal-T (belongs to) group-A (belongs to) group-B (.....) group-X
    </pre>
    To check whether the principal is allowed or disallowed for
    an action associated with ACL-Y,
    one has to check the principals from left to right against
    this ACL. As soon, as the principal/group is mentioned in ACL Y
    this ACL is in effect for principal-T. The permission of all
    groups following (on the right), are no longer of interrest.
    If the ACL is not mentioned in the chain at all, principal-T
    is disallowed for the action.
<li>Intrinsic hierachical inheritance is suppported as well as
    single explicit inheritance. See extra chapter below.  
</ul>
There is a <a href=Acls.html>list</a> of the ACLs associated with 
Eurogate commands.

<h3>Acl Inheritance</h3>
What does acl inheritance mean ? If acl-a inherits from acl-b,
acl-a adds all principal entries from acl-b to its own list,
BUT only if the principal in not yet in acl-a. So acl-b will never
overwrite an entry in acl-a. This does not 
depend on the value of the principal entry (allowed or denied).

<blockquote>
   <h4>Single explicit inheritance</h4>
       Each Acl can inherit from exactly ONE other acl. 
       This has to be set manually. Acls can build
       an inheritance chain.
       <pre>
        acl-a (inherits from) acl-b (inherits from) acl-c.
       </pre>   
       Nonexisting acl in a chain, invalide the whole chain.
       The result will always be a <b>deny</b>.   
   <h4>Intrinsic hierachical inheritance</h4>
   An acl implicitly inherits from a chain of wildcard acls.
   These inheritance scheme is not configurable.
   The standard acl consits of the <i>aclClassName</i> the <i>aclInstanceName</I>
   and the <i>action</i> which has to be protected.
   <pre>
     &lt;aclClassName&gt;.&lt;aclInstanceName&gt;.&lt;action&gt;
   </pre>
   The aclInstanceName can itself be devided into 
   an hierachical nameing scheme. The subitems are as well 
   separated by dots. <br>
   So the acl for the set operation of a drive may be :
   <pre>
       drive.stk-pvr.drive-0.modify
   </pre>
   The aclClass is the <i>drive</i> the aclInstance is
   <i>stk-pvr.drive-0</i> and the action is <i>modify</i>.
   The instanceName is devided into the drive container which
   is the pvr=stk-pvr and the drive name itself, which is 
   drive-0.<br>
   In this case the automatic inheritance scheme merges the
   following acls from top to bottom.
   <table border=1>
   <tr><th>aclClass</th><th colspan=2>aclInstanceName</th><th>action</th></tr>
   <tr align=center><td>drive</td><td>stk-pvr</td><td>drive-0</td><td>modify</td></tr>
   <tr align=center><td>drive</td><td>stk-pvr</td><td>drive-0</td><td>*</td></tr>
   <tr align=center><td>drive</td><td>stk-pvr</td><td>*</td><td>modify</td></tr>
   <tr align=center><td>drive</td><td>stk-pvr</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr>
   <tr align=center><td>drive</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>modify</td></tr>
   <tr align=center><td>drive</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr>
   <tr align=center><td>drive</td><td colspan=2>*</td><td>*</td></tr>
   <tr align=center><td>*</td><td colspan=2>*</td><td>*</td></tr>
   </table>
   So, the instanceName is simply replaced from right to left by 
   wildcards (without permutation) and the result is used together with
   the action and after that together with a wildcard repaceing the action.
   After these steps the composit instanceName is replaced by
   a single wildcard.
   The last acl merged is the superuser acl <i>*.*.*</i>.<br>
   Nonexisting acls will simply be skipped.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<strong>Drive Management</strong>
<blockquote>
EuroGate supports a large set of commands on drives for configuration,
adiminstration and operating purposes. These commands are of more or less interrest
for different people in charge for running the EuroGate system.
Therefore the command set is devided into three groups.
<ul>
<li>Commands for experts only. These commands are mainly for debugging
    and problem tracing.
<li>Configuration commands which allow to define the behaviour of the
    drive, like idle timer and the drive selection facility.
<li>Commands to operate the drive like enable/disable and dismounting
    drives.
</ul>
To fit these needs, three different action types on drives are defined
concerning the access control.
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Application</th><th>Acl</th><th>commands</th></tr>
<tr><td>Operating</td>
    <td>drive.&lt;pvrName&gt;.&lt;driveName&gt;.operate</td>
    <td>enable, disable, dismount</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Support<br>Configuration<br>Tuning</td>
    <td>drive.&lt;pvrName&gt;.&lt;driveName&gt;.support</td>
    <td>set drive</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Debugging</td>
    <td>drive.&lt;pvrName&gt;.&lt;driveName&gt;.expert</td>
    <td>deallocate<br>pvr mount|dismount|newdrive|unload</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
A common way to map these abilities to different people is to
create the appropriate number of groups with the 
correct acl profile and to add the related people to these groups.
<p>
The following commands realize exactly this scheme. Although
these commands could be delegated to other users, we assume that
we are currently holding the 'admin' account.
<pre>
#
#  we need to create the acl first.
#
create acl drive.stk.*.operate
create acl drive.stk.*.support
#
#  the commands could as well be 
#
create acl drive.*.*.operate
create acl drive.*.*.support
#
#  if the teams have to handle all pvrs.
#
#
#  create the groups
#
create group support
create group operating
#
#  add the groups to the related ACL's
#
add access -allowed drive.stk.*.operate operating
add access -allowed drive.stk.*.support  support
#
#  add users to the different groups.
#
add trude  to support
add snoopy to operating
</pre>
So, all users added to the group operating will have the drive.stk.*.operate
priviliges and all users added to the support group will have the
drive.stk.*.support
permission. But this is not exactly what we need. The support people should
as well be allowed to enable/disable/dismount drives.
We have at least 3 possibility to realize this idea.
<p><strong>Easy way</strong>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#
#  add the support group to the operating acl as well.
#
add access -allowed drive.stk.*.operate support
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Explicit inheritance</strong>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#
#  let all principals from support be also in operating.
#
let drive.stk.*.operate inheritfrom drive.stk.*.support
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Group managemenet</strong>
<blockquote>
<pre>
#
#  add the support group to the operating group.
#
add support to operating
</pre>
</blockquote>
Check the result :
<pre>
AclCell(admin) >> check pvr.stk.drive0.operate operating
<font color=green>Allowed</font>
AclCell(admin) >> check pvr.stk.drive0.support support
<font color=green>Allowed</font>
AclCell(admin) >> check pvr.stk.drive0.operate support
<font color=green>Allowed</font>
AclCell(admin) >> check pvr.stk.drive0.support operating
<font color=red>Denied</font>
</pre>
