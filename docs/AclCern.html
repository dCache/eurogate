<h1>EuroGate Acl Setup at CERN</h1>
Caused by the vast flexibility of the Acl subsystem,
the configuration my appear a bit long winded mainly because
the solutions are ambiguous.
To cut the possiblities down to a convenient arrangement,
we provide an acl setup for the CERN prototype.
The different acls are mapped to predefined groups.
So permissions are given to individuals by adding these to the
appropriate groups.
<p>
The group relations are illustrated in the graph below.
The users simply serve as an example.

<p>
The following sequence of commands will produce the
above picture. The commands must be issued under the
admin account as long as no acls are defined.
<p>
<strong>Remark about the admin user : </strong>
<blockquote>
   The admin user exists per default in some kind of
   zombie state. It can formally be used to log into
   the system but it has no further attributes.
   So as soon as the password for this account needs 
   to be changed, the account must be created.

<pre>
#
#  create the admin user
#
create user admin
#
# and now the groups
#
create group public
create group operating
create group support
create group developers
create group user-admin
#
#  not to forget the group relations
#
add operating  to public
add support    to operating
add developers to support
add user-admin to public   # not in picture
#
#  create the acls and assign them to the groups.
#
create acl user.*.*
create acl pvl.*.admin
create acl pvl.*.support
create acl pvl.*.operate
create acl vs.*.support
create acl pvr.*.admin
create acl pvr.*.operate
create acl drive.*.support
create acl drive.*.operate
create acl drive.*.expert
#
add access -allowed user.*.*        user-admin
add access -allowed drive.*.export  developers
add access -allowed pvl.*.admin     support
add access -allowed pvl.*.support   support
add access -allowed vs.*.support    support
add access -allowed pvr.*.admin     support
add access -allowed drive.*.support support
add access -allowed pvl.*.operate   operating
add access -allowed pvr.*.operate   operating
add access -allowed drive.*.operate operating
#
# create the example users
#
create user ingoa
set principal ingoa "fullName=Ingo Augustin" "eMail=ingoa@cern.ch"
create user hnms
set principal hnms "fullName=Helenic National Meteologic Services"
#
add ingoa to user-admin
add hnms  to operating
#
#   and so on
